# 🛍️ Ecommerce Web Design

An ecommerce website design inspired by the provided Figma UI.  
This project contains HTML, CSS, and JS files for a modern, responsive online shopping experience.

---

 ## 📌Project Overview
 
This project is built based on a Figma community design.  
It includes 5 main HTML pages with a responsive layout and reusable components.  
Perfect for beginners learning frontend development and for portfolio showcase.

- Built 5 pages:  
  - Home (`index.html`)  
  - Category (`category.html`)  
  - Products Listing (`products.html`)  
  - Product Details (`product-details.html`)  
  - Cart (`cart.html`)

- Focused on **desktop responsiveness** targeting screen widths **1024px and above**.  
- Mobile devices show an alert message indicating desktop-only support.  
- Layout uses **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox** for modern, clean design.  
- Hover effects and animations added to enhance user experience.  
- Images were downloaded from the Figma design, optimized without quality loss (PNG/JPG).  
- Fonts imported from **Google Fonts** (Inter, Nunito, Poppins, Rubik) using CSS `@import`.  
- Icons loaded via **Font Awesome CDN** and used in HTML elements.  
- JavaScript handles navigation toggle, cart functionality, and UI animations.  
- No external CSS or JS frameworks/libraries used.
